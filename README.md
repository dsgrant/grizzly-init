> X marks the spot, sourcemaps now working for js and sass

> Future me, create entry for webpack as config to support multiple files

> Fixed a pipe leak. Cleaned up a bit.

> Local folders will need babel, babel-loader, babel-core, babel-preset-es2015, gulp?

> Linked a local folder using npm link to test this package
